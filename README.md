# Tennis_Ladder_Website
A website for a tennis ladder

## Project Description 

The purpose of the software is to create a website that my dad and his friends can use for a tennis ladder. A tennis ladder system provides a friendly and competitive environment to help players improve their skills and meet others at about the same level.The software will allow everyone for easy access to view their rank and other’s ranks. It will also keep track of previous match wins and future matches.

The software will be a full functional website that I will host so my father and his friends can use for a tennis ladder. The website will have a login system for users and an editable profile, have a way to view the rankings of all members, have a way to view the winners of matches, have a way to challenge a person based on strict requirements, have a way to set up a tennis match with a date and time in mind, and have a way to send emails to the person that is challenged. Data will be entered into the website via the users themselves, mainly the winner of a specific match.

Here are the resources that will help me build this project. First, I have my dad as help with what he would want included on the website. He was the inspiration for this project, and I would want to make sure he is happy with it. Another resource I constantly use when building a website is W3Schools. They have every tutorial imaginable when it comes to building a website and I find myself referencing them often when I need help. 

Some similar software is really any ranking system, but the most popular ladder that is most similar to the one I am building is a chess ladder. Some examples of chess ladders can be found at websites such as Chess.com and Gameknot.com which host their own chess ladder.

My project plan is to start with a building out a mock website with all the webpages that I would include. Afterward, I would begin adding in functionality, starting with being able to view the databases and then being able to add information to the databases. The last thing I would work on would be the login system.

In conclusion, my goal for this project is that it will be used for a long time after it finished. I would like for it to be both part of my portfolio and have it used by my dad and his friends.
